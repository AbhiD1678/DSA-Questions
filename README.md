## First understand the questions correctly (try the below steps)
>Step 1: Verify all the constraints
>
>Step 2: Solve for the best case test case, which means for the input/test cases we know.
>
>Step 3:Figure out the solution without code
>
>Step 4:Write out the solution in the code
>
>Step 5:Double check for errors
>
>Step 6:Test our code with test cases
>
>Step 7:Analyse Space and Time complexity
>
>Step 8:Can we optimise our code ?
