    "Check if the head pointer is NULL (i.e., the list is empty). If it is, return true (an empty list is considered circular).\n",
    "Initialize a temporary pointer temp with the value of head.\n",
    "Enter a while loop that continues until either the head pointer becomes NULL or the head->next pointer points to the temp node.\n",
    "If the loop terminates because head is NULL, return false (indicating that the linked list is not circular).\n",
    "If the loop terminates because head->next points to temp, it means the linked list is circular, and the loop condition has been satisfied. In this case, return true.\n",
    "After the loop, check if either head or head->next is NULL. If either is NULL, return false (indicating that the linked list is not circular).\n",
    "If none of the above conditions are met, return true (indicating that the linked list is circular).\n",

    "Complexity\n",
    "Time Complexity: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The loop iterates through each node at most once.\n",
