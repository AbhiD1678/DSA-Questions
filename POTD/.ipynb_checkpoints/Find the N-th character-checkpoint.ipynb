    "This problem requires understanding the pattern that emerges after repeatedly applying the transformation of turning '0' into '01' and '1' into '10'. To find the nth character in the resulting pattern after r iterations, we need to observe and exploit certain properties of the transformation.\n",

    "Cyclical Pattern: The pattern repeats after a certain number of iterations. This is because the transformation alternates between '01' and '10', creating a cyclical pattern.\n",
    "Pattern Length: The length of the pattern after each iteration is related to powers of 2. Specifically, the length after the i-th iteration is 2^i.\n",
    "Index Calculation: To find the nth character, we need to calculate its index in the cyclical pattern. We do this by taking the modulo with the pattern length.\n",
    "Iteration Count: The number of iterations needed to exceed or equal n is determined by finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n.\n",
