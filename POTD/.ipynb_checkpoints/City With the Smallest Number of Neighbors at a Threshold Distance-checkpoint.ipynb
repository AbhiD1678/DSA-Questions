    "To solve this problem, we will use the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. We know the Floyd Warshall algorithm helps us to generate a 2D matrix that stores the shortest distances from each node to every other node. In the generated 2D matrix, each cell matrix[i][j] represents the shortest distance from node i to node j. After generating the 2D matrix(that contains the shortest paths) using the Floyd Warshall algorithm, for each node, we will count the number of nodes with a distance lesser or equal to the distance_Threshold by iterating each row of that matrix. Finally, we will choose the node with the minimum number of adjacent cities(whose distance is at the most distance_threshold) and with the largest value.\n",

    "Implementation:\n",
    "Graph Initialization: The code initializes a 2D vector cost to represent the graph with edge weights. The edge weights are based on the input edges. The matrix is initialized with a large value (1e5) to represent infinite distance. The loop iterates through the input edges and assigns their costs to the corresponding positions in the adjacency matrix.\n",
    "Diagonal Initialization: The diagonal elements (costs[i][i]) are set to 0, indicating that the distance from a node to itself is zero.\n",
    "Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: The code then applies the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the graph. The triple-nested loop updates the distances between nodes by considering all possible intermediate nodes.\n",
    "Counting Reachable Cities: The code then iterates through each city and counts the number of cities that can be reached within the given distanceThreshold. This is done by checking if the distance between the current city (i) and each other city (j) is less than or equal to the threshold.\n",
    "Finding the Result: The code keeps track of the city with the smallest number of reachable cities within the distance threshold (ans), and its index is returned as the result.\n",

    "Complexity:\n",
    "Time Complexity: : The time complexity is dominated by the Floyd-Warshall algorithm, which is O(n^3), where n is the number of nodes (cities).\n",
