    "Expected Approach\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The key idea behind the approach is to exploit the alternating ascending and descending order of the linked list. By splitting it into two halves based on this pattern, we obtain one half sorted in ascending order and the other in descending order. Reversing the descending half transforms it into ascending order, enabling a straightforward merge operation to combine both halves into a single sorted list, achieving the desired non-decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation\n",
    "Split the Linked List:\n",
    "We start by splitting the original linked list into two halves: one containing nodes in ascending order and the other containing nodes in descending order.\n",
    "We use the splitList function for this purpose. This function iterates through the original list, alternatingly adding nodes to the ascending and descending halves.\n",
    "Reverse the Descending Half:\n",
    "After splitting, we have two separate linked lists: one in ascending order and the other in descending order.\n",
    "We reverse the descending half using the reverselist function. This ensures that both halves are sorted in ascending order.\n",
    "Merge the Sorted Halves:\n",
    "Now that both halves are sorted in ascending order, we merge them back into a single sorted linked list.\n",
    "We use the mergelist function to merge the ascending and reversed descending halves into a single sorted list.\n",
    "This function compares the data of nodes from both halves and appends them to the merged list in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "Return the Sorted List:\n",
    "Finally, we return the head of the merged sorted list.\n",
