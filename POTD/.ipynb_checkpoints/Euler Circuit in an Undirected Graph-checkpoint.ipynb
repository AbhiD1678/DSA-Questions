    "Expected Approach:\n",

    "\n",
    "Eulerian Circuit: An Eulerian circuit is a closed path within a graph that visits every edge exactly once.\n",
    "Eulerian Path: An Eulerian path is a path that visits every edge exactly once, but doesn't necessarily need to return to the starting point.\n",
    "Conditions for Eulerian Circuits/Paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "Eulerian Circuit: A graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if all vertices have an even degree (number of edges connected to the vertex).\n",
    "Eulerian Path: A graph has an Eulerian path if and only if there are exactly zero or two vertices with an odd degree.\n",
    "Slide---1.pngSlide---1.png\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 1 : The graph is not Eulerian. Note that there are four vertices with odd degree (0,1,3 and 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 2 : The graph has Eulerian Cycles, for example \"2 1 0 3 4 0 2\". Note that all vertices have even degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slide 3 : The graph has Eulerian Paths, for example \"4 3 0 1 2 0\", but no Eulerian Cycle. Note that there are two vertices with odd degree (4 and 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "Representing Edges: The code uses eu and ev vectors to store the vertices involved in each edge. This aids in tracking visited edges and building the circuit.\n",
    "Checking for Eulerian Conditions: The isEularCircuitExist function first verifies if the graph meets the conditions for having an Eulerian circuit or path (even degrees or at most two odd-degree vertices).\n",
    "Building the Adjacency List: A new adjacency list (adj1) is created, not based directly on vertex-vertex connections, but on edge indices. This is used for efficient traversal during the Depth-First Search.\n",
    "Depth-First Search (DFS): The dfs function performs a modified DFS. Key points:\n",
    "Edge Traversal: It focuses on traversing edges rather than nodes directly.\n",
    "Used Tracking: The used vector keeps track of visited edges to ensure no edge is used twice.\n",
    "Building the Circuit: As the DFS progresses, vertices are added to the ans vector, forming the Eulerian circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity:\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(V + E) - Linear, as each edge and vertex are processed once during initialization and DFS.\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(V + E) - Space is used to store vectors (used, eu, ev, ans) and the set (st)."
