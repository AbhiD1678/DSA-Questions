    "Expected Approach\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The key idea behind this approach is to iterate through each bit position from 0 to 31 and count the number of elements in the array where that bit is set. Then, calculate the sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs using this bit position. Finally, sum up these bitwise AND sums for all bit positions to get the total sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs.\n",

    "Implementation\n",
    "Initialize the variable ans to 0, which will store the sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs.\n",
    "Iterate through each bit position from 0 to 31.\n",
    "Inside the loop, initialize a variable k to 0, which will count the number of elements in the array where the current bit is set.\n",
    "Iterate through each element j in the array.\n",
    "Check if the i-th bit of element j is set using the bitwise AND operation (j & (1 << i)).\n",
    "If the i-th bit of j is set, increment the value of k.\n",
    "After iterating through all elements, calculate the sum of pairwise bitwise ANDs for the current bit position using the formula (1 << i) * (k * (k - 1) // 2). This formula represents the number of pairs where the i-th bit is set for both elements.\n",
    "Add this sum to the ans.\n",
    "After iterating through all bit positions, return the final value of ans, which represents the sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "Let's consider the example with N = 3 and Arr = {5, 10, 15}.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each bit position from 0 to 31, we'll count the number of elements in the array where that bit is set. Here's how it looks:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 0th bit: There are 2 elements with the 0th bit set (5 and 15).\n",
    "For the 1st bit: There is 1 element with the 1st bit set (5).\n",
    "For the 2nd bit: There are 3 elements with the 2nd bit set (5, 10, and 15).\n",
    "For the 3rd bit onwards: There are no elements with these higher bits set.\n",
    "Now, we'll calculate the sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs using each bit position:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the 0th bit: 0th bit set in 5 and 15. So, the sum is 0.\n",
    "For the 1st bit: 1st bit set in 5. So, the sum is 5.\n",
    "For the 2nd bit: 2nd bit set in 5, 10, and 15. So, the sum is 10 + 5 = 15.\n",
    "Finally, we sum up these bitwise AND sums: 0 + 5 + 15 = 20. Therefore, the total sum of bitwise ANDs of all pairs is 20\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. Here we are using nested loop but outer loop runs only 32 times hence overall time complexity will be O(32*N) which is approximately equals to O(N).\n",
    "Space Complexity: O(1). The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size."
