    "Expected Approach\n",
    "Intuition\n",
    "The key idea behind this approach is to use the bitwise XOR operation to find the single element in the array. When we perform XOR operation between two same numbers, the result is 0. So, if we perform XOR operation on all elements in the array, the result will be the single element that appears only once\n",
